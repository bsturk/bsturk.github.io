    Since I didn't get the 25" cabinet I wanted I decided to
    use a rotating monitor setup.  This allows vertical games
    to use most if not all of the usable area of the monitor.  
    Unfortunately it's a major PITA to build.  Most of the time 
    I've spent on this project was on the monitor harness.  
    I followed pretty much the exact design as the one located here
    at <a href="http://lillypad.4mg.com/">The Lilypad</a>.

    I bought a low end 19" PC monitor ( MAG ) non flat screen.  I
    then removed all of the plastic housing and disconnected
    the controls on the front of the monitor.

    I won't go over again how to build the harness as it's covered
    nicely by The Lilypad, but I will mention the issues I ran
    into.  I had to do every part of the monitor setup
    at least twice.

    First of all it's tough to cut a perfect circle with a jigsaw. My first
    one was bad, the second one was better but still not perfect. Flaws will
    be magnified when rotating the monitor as I've found out. Cutting the
    hole for the monitor proved to be just as difficult. I tried all kinds
    of different ways to trace and measure the front of the monitor and the
    4 holes for mounting. What I ended up doing was tracing the front on
    paper and then cutting that out of the paper and then drawing around the
    inside of the hole onto the particle board wheel. This got me in the
    general area. I did do a lot of filing and retrying until it finally fit
    through. The monitor is awkward and fragile so this was scary to do this
    many times. I tested the monitor before mounting it permanently just in
    case.

    The hardware of the monitor needed to be supported since the plastic    
    housing was now gone. I used the same plumbing metal stripping to       
    create a bracket to hold it in place. As I found out later it didn't    
    work so great ( I've got the cuts and bruises to prove it ). As you can 
    see in the background of the middle picture there's a table saw on my   
    porch and the floor is covered in sawdust. I can't stress enough how    
    much easier the table saw made this project. Measuring and installing   
    this stuff at angles inside of the cramped cabinet was also a pain.

    The monitor cord wasn't very long, and the extensions I've found
    had ghosting problems so I had to limit the monitor to move only 90 degrees
    total, which is really all it needs.  This is the reason for the painted
    H and V.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>:)</b>

    I used a razor blade and masking tape to cut out the area in the front
    glass where the monitor would line up with when it was in the vertical position.
    I put a small kitchen cabinet handle to use for rotating
    the monitor.  I also modified a Happs 19" bezel to put in there also.
    I then attached two strips of velcro to the monitor glass so I could pull
    it back to rotate the monitor until I get a motor installed to do the
    rotating.

    A few months after finishing the monitor I started getting flickering when rotating
    and diagonal lines when powered up.  I spent a night tracing it down
    to a header on the monitor PCB that was slipping off.  This must have been
    due to all the jostling when cutting the hole for it.

    I spliced the wiring for the monitor controls ( since I needed to
    degauss, power on, etc ), put a grommet in the top of the cabinet, and
    velcro'ed them on the top of the cab though the grommet. I mounted
    the volume control up here as well.  I'll also be putting the rocker
    switch for the monitor motor next to this stuff someday when I get around to it.

Here is a pic of the current monitor with bezel and glass.  The monitor is now a true arcade monitor
from Wells Gardner.  I'm using the same cut out bezel.  The glass is now a piece of tempered clear glass on top of
Defender bezel artwork and behind that is a piece of tempered smoked glass.  This is held together with small pressure clips.
