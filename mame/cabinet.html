    I picked up the cabinet on eBay for about 100 bucks, with shipping      
    it totaled $275! &nbsp; I recommend trying to find one locally before going this   
    route. The cabinet was a working Klax that had been converted from      
    a Bally Sente game ( I think it was a "Blades of Steel" ).  One of my goals was
    to not ruin a perfectly working "original" game or one that could be fixed
    up.  This one had been through enough changes already that I didn't feel
    too bad about it.
<p>    
I had wanted to get a 25" cabinet but was way too impatient. 
I'm half glad I was.  Most of the games I remember had 19" monitors and having played
the "reunion" cab which is 25" I have to say that I don't really like it.  I do wish I had
tried to get an old Atari style cab like Centipede or Dig Dug.

<p>    
The cabinet was in good shape, monitor had some burn in and one of the casters had broke from the  
particle board bottom either during shipping or while we were lugging it in the house. 
These things are *HEAVY*.  Here's a picture of the cabinet before it shipped to my house.

    First I completely gutted it, saving everything, and cleaned it. I
    patched the small holes on the sides with wood putty because I knew
    I wanted to put artwork on the sides. Originally I was going to buy
    Defender stencils but went with something sort of original instead.

    I painted the whole thing, first with latex primer and later with flat
    black latex paint.  I also put a few coats of polyurethane on the outside.
    I removed the monitor ( after discharging it ) and marked the angle
    the stand was at to be able to duplicate it later, and then removed the wooden
    monitor stand and metal brackets.  Here are some pictures of it in progress.

    For sound I used a Cambridge Soundworks system with sub-woofer. It       
    sounds great. I must have listened to the "insert coin" sound on        
    Defender 50 times after I hooked it up. I used some flexible plumbing   
    strip metal and some wood blocks to mount the speakers aside of the     
    existing speaker. There is a grill that covers this area so it should   
    look OK. I did a horrible job with the jigsaw cutting the holes for the 
    speakers and as a result you could see the marquee light coming through 
    which was annoying. Some Taco Bell napkins strategically stuffed around 
    the speakers did the trick.  I eventually had to do a little soldering
    on the woofer PCB because it would cut in and out while playing a game.
    Most of the screws holding down exposed parts of the machine, including
    the mesh speaker cover, are of the type "locking torque".  I found mine
    at an auto parts store.

    I use PinMAME as well as MAME so I wanted to have pinball flippers
    on the machine. This wasn't too bad using a 1 1/8" bi-metal hole saw
    attached to my handheld drill. See below for the link to PinMAME, it's
    as close as you can get to the real thing without having it take up half
    your living room.

    The marquee lamp worked but was hooked up to the original ( now removed )
    circuitry so I just used an old AC cord and soldered it together.

    The cabinet seemed a little low to me so I built a small platform for
    the cabinet to sit on.  Some 2x4s and 3/4" perf board worked just
    fine.
