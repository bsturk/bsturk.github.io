<h2><blink>WARNING!! Lots of large images</blink></h2>

    The control panel was the other difficult part of the project.  As
    I've mentioned before, I'm not the most handy person, so building
    a new wooden control panel box was out of the question.  I have a
    metal control panel which is more difficult to put controls into also.

<p>
    I didn't have a lot of space for joysticks and buttons so I decided
    at first to make swappable control panels.  I used this setup for almost 2
    years.  I made 5 panels but found it still wasn't good enough.  I wanted 
    to do more combinations of controls but not have to make lots of full panels 
    and buy duplicates of expensive controls like spinners and trackballs.  
    I also wanted to use the original controls which are hard to find 
    and aren't practical for dedicating an entire panel to.  My solution to 
    these issues was going to a modular panel.  I now have the flexibility to do
    just about anything!

    The control panel in the state I got it had a large rectangle cut out of the
    middle with another piece of metal attached via torque screws which
    had the holes for the joysticks/buttons.  It was suggested to put
    rivet nuts around the outside of the hole and then use a steel plate
    to hold the controls.

    <p>
    I could have used the existing opening but it just didn't look very good
    and since I had already used the 10x22 sheet metal panels for my older 
    swappable panels, I opted to just make yet one more panel but have
    it be modular.  This turned out to be a good choice because the steel
    plate makes the whole assembly a lot more rigid.  Plus it can be easily
    removed.

    <p>
    To make this panel I brought one of the 10x22 sheet metal plates to a
    machine shop and they cut out a rectange using a plasma cutter.  I was
    surprised at how accurate the cut was and it only cost me $15.  I also
    painted the panel w/ black Hammerite paint.  Below is the sheet metal plate
    attached to the cp.

    <p>
    <img SRC="pics/bare_panel_w_rivets.jpg">

    <p>
    The idea I came up with was to use standard rack mount parts.  The control 
    modules are attached to standard rack rails.
    
    <p>
    <img SRC="pics/rack_rails.jpg">

    The rails are attached to the sheet metal panel on the top and bottom
    and sunk low enough to make the modules lie flush with the top.
    
    <p>
    <img SRC="pics/rack_rails_attached.jpg">

    The controls themselves are mounted to rack mount blanker panels of different sizes
    (1U, 2U, 3U, etc).  This allowed for there to be no gaps between them and
    I didn't have to make them.  I had the blank panels, which are 19" long, cut
    into 2 8" peices and had the holes on the ends added to the ones that didn't
    have them.

    <p>
    <img SRC="pics/many_modules.jpg">

    The blanker panels are 1/8" aluminum which is *very* sturdy and much easier
    to cut through than plate steel.  It takes me about a minute to do a 1 1/8"
    hole now rather than 10+ minutes with the steel.  These are the ones used
    for 3" Happs trackballs.  Standard rack mount 10/32 screws hold these down.

    <p>
    <img SRC="pics/trackball_modules.jpg">
    <p>

    I previously used molex connectors to be able to switch between controls.  
    I now use Ethernet cables along w/ a patch panel and pass thru 'keystone' jacks.
    I just plug the modules into the jacks.  The molex shown is to power things like
    the light under the trackball.  I have also colored coded the ends of the ethernet
    jacks so I know where they go.

    <p>
    Here you can see the rats nest of the inside of the cabinet.
    The ethernet cables are going to strip terminals and then going to the IPAC/OptiPAC.
    They plug into the opposite side of the punch panel since I used what are called "passthru"
    jacks.  Makes it a lot easier than crimping.

    This is the board all of the interfaces is mounted to.  These are necessary to connect the
    classic controls to the computer.

Here are some pictures of the control module layouts I've made so far.  The modular artwork was done
a long time ago by someone on arcadecontrols and I recently (2016) cleaned it up and had it printed
on vinyl w/ polycarbonate protectant on top.  Looks awesome.

    I used leaf style switches for everything except for
    the pinball buttons and the 1UP/2UP buttons.  In my opinion there's
    no comparing them to microswitches.  The clicking of the microswitches 
    was really annoying.  All old arcade machines as far as I've read 
    had leaf switch types and they're getting harder to find these days.  
    They also require a little TLC to work just right.

    For interfacing with the computer I used <a href="http://www.ultimarc.com/">Ultimarc's</a> IPAC,
    OPTIPac, and APac.  I also use a GPWiz-49, an interface for the SNK joystick, and an LEDWiz.  
    No fuss, and all work very well with MAME.
