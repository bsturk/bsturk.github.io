    Since I first saw Dave Spicer's arcade emulator, Sparcade ('95/'96), which
    played Galaxian and Pac-Man, I had wanted to build a cabinet to play these 
    games the way they were meant to be.  Sitting at your desk or on the floor just isn't
    the same as being at a real stand up machine with a real arcade joystick or trackball.

    Here's a
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=cabinet+author:bsturk%40nh.ultranet.com&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=3463A5F5.CA81DA68%40nh.ultranet.com&rnum=2.">posting</a>
    I made to Usenet in '97 asking some newbie questions.  I'd wait much longer
    to start though...

    <p>
    Finally, in late 2001, I had enough free time to build my own. And what a project it   
    has been. It took a little over 3 months to get the entire cabinet finished and
    it's now mostly done.  I did the work on 3 fronts: in the living room, our 3 season
    porch, and in the basement so I was quite popular.  All work on the new
    house stopped in favor of my new obsession.  It was at times frustrating
    but the finished product is *WELL* worth the time and effort.  It's now
    pretty much done except for the occasional update which I log 
    <a href="recent.html">here</a>.

    I'd like to thank a few people for pitching in.  The games
    are set to "free play" when they're here! &nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>:)</b>

    Karey (lots of patience and hands), Darren C, Shawn P, Tim L, and Home
    Depot for being open until 11pm. I'd also like to acknowledge all of the
    other people who have built a cabinet and put up a web page. My cabinet
    is combination of some of the cool ideas in other cabinets with a few of
    my own ideas. I wouldn't have had a chance without their great examples.  Thanks
    also to all of the emulator developers.  What these guys do is pure programming magic.

    Also visit

    for lots of info on the subject.
