Sub WordSelect()
'DESCRIPTION: Selects a word like a double click with mouse
					   'Very handy for keyboard users. Not the prettiest 
					   'or quickest (I heard BASIC was slow!  :] ) 
					   'macro but it works better than the built in word right after Alt-M or 
					   'C in BRIEF, etc and more accurate, also helps RSI sufferers like me.
					   '
					   'Valid characters are all upper case and lower case letters 
					   'and the underscore "_" character.  
					   
					   'Rev 1 - Got it working without checking for individual chars
					   '			instead used the numerical comparisons  
					   '						
					   'Rev 2 - Added numbers to be valid during string	search
					   '			Now supports all valid C/C++ chars duh!
					   '
					   'Rev 3 - (7/12/98) Added check for first column, also tidy'd 
					   '			 up code for checking for valid letters from ranges
					   '			 to using InStr w/ valid chars (Thanks David Cotton)
					   '			 BTW I never claimed to be a VB guy!   :)
