    Vim has some cool features that are not found in other editors.  These

    <UL>
    <LI> Vertically split windows ( a very welcomed feature! ).

    <LI> Diff mode.  You can now use use vim to do graphical diffs of files.

    <LI> Folding.  You can hide functions, comments, or arbitrary segments
         of your file to help readability etc.

    <LI> A new file browser script ala dired in Emacs.  Very nice.
         I would love to see a 2 pane version like the venerable
         Norton/Midnight Commander clones.

    <LI> You can now communicate between Vims.  This is a very
         cool feature allowing you to, for instance, use
         one instance of vim to edit files.  But that's
         just the tip of the iceberg of what this feature
         can be used for.

    <LI>Syntax hilighting for many, many languages, and it's seemingly infinitely comfigurable.
        No compiling DLLs either.

    <LI>Vim has been ported to numerous operating systems including Amiga DOS, MS-DOS,
        MS-Windows 95/98/NT (Win 3.1 coming), Atari MiNT, Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost
        all flavours of UNIX. <b>Where are those 8-bit ports? :)</b>

    <LI>"Almost" Vi compatible.  From most accounts it's compatability is pretty high.  Vim is
        my first experience with Vi so I know no better!

    <LI>The source code is freely available so if you want, you can work on
        it or add some functionality to it.

    <LI>A powerful built in scripting language, and also support for Perl, TCL, Ruby, and Python.

    These excellent utilities help to integrate Vim into the windows environment
    just a little better.  OpenWithVim allows directing any file to *one* instance of Vim
    using OLE. SendToVim allows sending any vim commands to the running instance. Very cool!
    Both programs are part of the extra zip included with the distribution.  The 6.0
    betas now have this functionality built in for all platforms using arguments to
    vim (+clientserver).

    For those who use Visual C++ and edit with Vim this might interest you.

    If you compile Vim for the Win32 platform yourself, add the two files that are located 
    <a href="programs/vimvccmd.zip">here</a>, and add them to the project.  The header file has instructions on how to add
    this functionality within Vim.  Hopefully this will be added as a compile option into the 
    main Vim code base but I want to do further testing and add a little more functionality before
    submitting it.  NOTE: This code is not a stellar example of how to use ATL, feel free to
    clean it up, it was also created around the time of 5.7 so it's probably a
    little different now.

    Features ( not all are implemented yet ):

    <UL>
    <LI>Can execute any command that is listed in the Tools->Customize->Keyboard property page.
        The command for this is vc.  
        <br>
        For example on the command/ex mode line type ":vc DebugGo"
        and you'll start debugging.  If VC++ is not running an instance will start.

    <LI>Will open a file in VC++ from within Vim.  This allows the two way connection with VisVim
        providing the other direction.

    <LI>Set a breakpoint in VC++ from within Vim.  Give the file and line number and a breakpoint
        will be set there.  I'm not sure how useful seeing what breakpoints are set from within
        Vim would be , and I imagine synchronizing them will involve changes to VisVim.  I'm be happy
        just to be able to set a breakpoint from within and kick off the debugger.

    Works if you have a python enabled [g]vim and the platform you run

    tricks like !r <cmd>.  It will maintain, for example, the process
    environment because the shell process is the same.
