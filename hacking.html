The MV 8000 and 8800 series groovebox/production studios are amazing pieces of hardware.  They pack a ton
of DAW functionality into a pretty integrated hardware box.  I love mine but there were small things I wanted to change or
add so I took on the (way more challenging than I expected) project of modifying the firmware.  At this point I am able
to make changes to the 8800's main firmware and have made a few improvements/tweaks so far, including:

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Project loading/saving for projects incorporates how many songs are in the project, so loading and saving times are much faster.
    <li>Some annoying popups are now gone
    <li>The direction of the scroll wheel can be reversed (this was a big one for me)
    <li>Small tweaks to wording, etc
</ul>

<p>
I have much more planned too!  There was a lot to do to get to the point of being able to make changes and most of it is documented
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210517034149/https://www.mv-nation.com/index.php?topic=227.0">here</a> at the mv-nation forum archive.

<p>
What I enjoy most about this project is it involves reversing both the hardware at a very low level (things like chip selects, registers, etc) and all of the software with many challenges along the way.  
I also learned a new processor instruction set and architecture (SuperH, thanks to Ghidra and a ton of autoit) and many other things as a result of all the work.  Very rewarding, plus my old sampler is getting updated!

Picked this up as "non-working" on eBay for $25.  It had some issues which were easily fixed (screen was busted, battery dead).
Did most of the recommended updates in the service manual, new screen, retrobrited the buttons and circuit bent it including a few types of bends I haven't seen on other builds.

<p>
The OS and both sound roms are now external to the unit and can be swapped out for changing from the stock sounds.  This is a pretty common mod.
<p>
The circuit bends on my unit are the standard ROM/RAM patch points for which I used tiny 2.54mm sockets rather than banana or 3.5mm jacks.  
Any of these can be routed to momentary or toggle switches in addition to be being controlled via the 4 3.5mm trigger inputs.  These 4 inputs
connect to a 4066 switch chip.  When the chip gets a 5v signal, it "shorts" the 2 patched inputs, so you can externally control bends with something
like an Ardunio, Teensy, or the gate/trigger output of modular synths.  I had planned on wiring up all of the 16 pads to be triggered externally as 
well but the trigger pads at best (based on my testing w/ a siggen) can be triggered around 25Hz.  Notes can be triggered MUCH faster via MIDI.
<p>
I also did the standard LTC1799 pitch control, but with a few twists.  First a 3 way toggle to go through all the different ranges of the LTC
circuit.  And in addition to the course and fine pot controls, I made a vactrol out of a white LED and photoresistor which allows me to connect 
up CV from my modular synths to control pitch.  There's also a resistive strip and photoresistor that can drive the LTC.
<p>
There are 2 toggle and 4 momentary switches for controlling bends or the pitch on/off.
<p>
I may try reversing the firmware and making some updates at some point.  Would love to have pitch and decay envelopes for the individual sounds.

    First of 3 wiring attempts using sockets and jumper cables (ended up being too stiff), finalized on hardwiring to board w/ soft IDE cables to sockets

The Yamaha RX5 is an amazing drum machine, even not modified.  There are way more options for munging the sounds on it than most other drum machines.
There is also a cart available, the RX5USB, which allows you to write your own samples to the on board EPROM and use it in the RX5.

The Alesis QSR is a rompler, but allows for using your own samples via a PCMCIA RAM Card.  It also has a decent modulation matrix.
Bending this was a super pain due to the placement and pitch of the mask roms, and the OS is very touchy about address changes.

The Roland TR-626 came out in 1987.  OK sounds, but with the bends and different ROMs you can get lots of interesting variations, including mucking with
the patterns which most bent drum machines won't do.
<p>
Changes made were:

<p>

<tr><td width="100%" align="left">
<p>
I installed a ROM Expansion kit and also broke out the pins to an external ZIF socket so I can change the sounds easily.
The stock sounds are still installed inside.  The switches to swap between chips and banks are in the sockets so I can do this on
the fly (which makes for some cool sounds).
<p>
The circuit bends ROM patch points for which I used tiny 2.54mm sockets rather than banana or 3.5mm jacks.  
Any of these can be routed to 2 momentary and 2 toggle switches in addition to be being controlled via the 2 3.5mm trigger inputs.  These 4 inputs
connect to a 4066 switch chip.  When the chip gets a 5v signal, it "shorts" the 2 patched inputs, so you can externally control bends with something
like an Ardunio, Teensy, or the gate/trigger output of modular synths.
<p>
I also did the standard LTC1799 pitch control.  First a 3 way toggle to go through all the different ranges of the LTC
circuit.  And in addition to the course and fine pot controls.  The input into the LTC is a socket pair, so I can plug in
a photoresistor or vactrol, etc.
<p>
There are 2 toggle and 2 momentary switches for controlling bends or the pitch on/off.
<p>
Swapped out the soldered on button battery for a case and on/off switch.
