    These are just some pictures of the room I spend a *lot* of time
    in.  And with good reason!  :)  As a kid I always fantasized about
    a room just for my computer related stuff.  Well, here it is!

My workstation(s).  Computer on left runs Gentoo Linux.  The one on right runs
WinXP I have a KVM to switch between the two and two more if needed and an amp 
that lets me switch inputs so I can get sound from either.  I can either 
stand or sit when using this setup with adjustable monitor and work area.

My 8 bit setup.  There's a lot of different configurations I can do here.  I
can hook up any of the old computers to either the 1702 monitor, TV, or
the Amdek monitor.  I can also run emulators via TV-out to the same
video outputs.  I have also built cables to interface some of the old computers
to the PC allowing it to act as a file server.

Here are some pictures of the process of getting images between the PC and the old computers.  I can do this with just about all
of my 
<a href="stuff.html">vintage computers</a>
but this particular example shows the C64 and the X1541 cable.

The picture below shows using the excellent Star Commander program to transfer disk images over to the C64.

Just a TV for sitting down and playing games.  I'm blind so the
bigger screen helps.  :)  It can also be raised/lowered so I can
play in a chair or sitting on the floor.  Below are pics of Telengard (via VICE) and
Star Raiders (via Atari800WinPlus)

Storing all this stuff takes up a lot of space.  Here's a picture of the way I deal with this.
This is a pretty old pic and there is a lot less room now.   :)

This switch allows me to choose the output source for emulator output.  The TV, 1702, 1084s.  The thing I like about
my 1084s is that it also has a very cool green "monochrome" switch.  I had one of these monitors a long time ago and it
is still cool to use.

I also have a few old dot matrix printers.  Currently I have a Star Micronics NX-1000C and an Imagewriter II.  These are getting to be hard to find as well
as finding ribbons for them unfortunately.  If you look really good in this pic you can see the frontend I wrote to launch games for different systems.
